The Surface of Mars
Standing outside of the Martian Base you can see for miles, there is not much around
and it's best not to travel too far until you are better prepared.

Site of the crashed Lander
Part of the base includes a launch pad for incoming and outcoming shipments

Martian Base
Inside of the Martian base, there are some computer systems, a small kitchen, and some tables.
This connects to the rest of the base

Base Hangar
Inside of the base is a large hangar meant for working on a lander, there is a broken rover 
and some tools but otherwise empty.
