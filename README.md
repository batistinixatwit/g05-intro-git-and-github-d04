The Surface of Mars
Standing outside the Martian Base you can see for miles, there is not much around,
and it's best not to travel too far until you are better prepared.

Site of the crashed Lander
Part of the base includes a launch pad for incoming and outgoing shipments

Martian Base
Inside the Martian base, there are some computer systems, a small kitchen, and some tables.
This connects to the rest of the base

Base Hangar
Inside the base is a large hangar meant for working on a lander, there is a broken rover
and some tools but otherwise empty.
Use tools that are found like a wrench to fix inportant machines, complete the tasks.
